# dragondrop Self-Hosting Compute
Terraform code for deploying the compute resources needed to run dragondrop.cloud within your Google Cloud environment.

## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own cloud environment.

It defines a [Cloud Run Service](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/cloud-run-job-http-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a provisioned Cloud Run Job.

The url for this Cloud Run Service is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition as that Job's "HTTPS Url".

The Cloud Run Job hosts dragondrop's proprietary container. All environment variables that need to be configured are references
to secrets within Google Secret Manager, and can be customized like any other secret.

### Security When Using This Module
This module creates a new IAM role, "dragondrop HTTPS Trigger Role" which has the minimum permissions needed to evoke
Cloud Run Jobs. This role is assigned to a new service account, and that service account is the service account used by both the
Cloud Run Service and Cloud Run Job provisioned by this module.

Lastly, that service account is granted Secret Accessor privileges on only the secrets referenced by the Cloud Run Job as
environment variables.
