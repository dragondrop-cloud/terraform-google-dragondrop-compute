# Google Dragondrop Self-Hosting Compute
Terraform code for deploying the compute services needed to run dragondrop.cloud within your cloud.

## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own cloud environment.

It defines a [Cloud Run Service](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/cloud-run-job-http-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a Cloud Run Job. The url for this Cloud Run service
is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition.

### Limitations
Currently, the GCP provider [does not support](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/issues/11743)
 Cloud Run Jobs, so users will need to manually create their own Cloud Run Job instance to host the dragondrop core engine itself.

As soon as the GCP provider implements this functionality, we will release a new version of this module.
