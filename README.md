## How to Use this Module
This module defines the compute resources needed to run dragondrop within your own GCP environment.

It defines a [Cloud Run Service](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/cloud-run-job-http-trigger) that can
evoke the longer running dragondrop engine living in a provisioned Cloud Run Job.

The url for this Cloud Run Service is output and should be passed to a dragondrop [Job](https://docs.dragondrop.cloud/product-docs/getting-started/creating-a-job)
definition as that Job's "HTTPS Url".

The Cloud Run Job hosts the [cloud-concierge](https://github.com/dragondrop-cloud/cloud-concierge) container. All environment
variables are set by the dragondrop platform, except for a VCS personal access token stored in Google Secrets manager and an optional
Terraform Cloud organization token.

### Security When Using This Module
This module creates two IAM roles.

1) "dragondrop HTTPS Trigger Role" which has the minimum permissions needed to evoke
Cloud Run Jobs. This role is assigned to a new service account, and that service account is the service account used by both the
Cloud Run Service.

2) "cloud-concierge-execution-role" is granted Secret Accessor privileges on only the secrets referenced by the Cloud Run Job as
environment variables, read-only access to the cloud environment, and optionally, read-only access to the GCS bucket used for Terraform state.
This role is used by the Cloud Run Job that hosts the cloud-concierge container.
